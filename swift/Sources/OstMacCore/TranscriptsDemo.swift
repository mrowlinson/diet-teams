// TranscriptsDemo.swift — om-transcripts-build lane: offline demo rows + VTT.

// Demo people are western names only (owner standing rule): the same
// four the rest of `--demo` uses. The synthetic VTT doubles as the
// live-verify upload body (same bytes up, down, and through the unit
// parser matrix), so its turns are pinned by tests.
