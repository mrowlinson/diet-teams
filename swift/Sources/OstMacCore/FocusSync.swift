// FocusSync.swift — e2-attention lane: macOS Focus sync.
//
// System Focus/DND quiets the app with EXACTLY quiet-hours semantics:
// the app folds `FocusSyncStore.quietNow` into the same quiet snapshot
// the ingest path and the rules gate already read (ChatFilter reason
// "quiet-hours" is reused — ChatFilter is read-only for this lane).
//
// R1 mechanism (probed 2026-09-25, macOS 27, NO public API reads Focus
// state): best-effort parse of ~/Library/DoNotDisturb/DB/Assertions.json
// — a non-empty `storeActiveAssertionRecords` in data[0] means a Focus
// mode is active. Verified shape with Focus OFF (only invalidation
// records); the active shape is inferred from Apple's key naming and
// the parser is tolerant (missing key = inactive, never an error).
// This is a private artifact: it may move across OS releases, so every
// failure path fails OPEN (unreadable ⇒ not quiet, never stuck silent)
// and records `error` for Diagnostics. The `FocusReader` seam keeps
// tests hermetic (mock reader, never the live system in tests).
