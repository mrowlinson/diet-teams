// ComposeAttachments.swift — om-attach lane: composer attachments.
//
// Attach button (native NSOpenPanel) + send-with-upload through the existing
// files-upload path (RustCore.sharedUpload → ostmac_files_upload). Chat ids
// skip the team scan in core (files.rs upload_file_data routes on
// is_channel_id: channels resolve the team folder, chats go straight to the
// sender's OneDrive chat-files folder). Files over 4 MB stage as .tooLarge
// and ride core's resumable session path (om-i4-bigup); % polls the core
// gauge per in-flight file while its spinner runs.
//
//   let a = ComposeAttachmentsStore()
//   a.stage(urls: panel.urls)          // probe sizes, flag large files
//   await a.uploadPending(chatID: id)  // staged + large, in order
//
// Tests inject mock upload/size seams (same pattern as SharedFilesStore).
